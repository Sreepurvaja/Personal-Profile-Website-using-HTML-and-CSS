# Personal-Profile-Website-using-HTML-and-CSS

##Step 1: Planning and Preparation:

The purpose of this website is to train me in HTML and CSS and recap of it to do more like this.

##Step 2: Setting Up the Project:

Create a main project folder with a name like “PersonalWebsite.”
Inside this folder, create subfolders for different types of files css for CSS files, “images” for 
images, and so on.
Create an “app.html” file in the main folder for the HTML.

##Step 3: HTML Page Creation:

The following HTML files are created for the purpose of : This file showcases the individual's 
portfolio of projects. It includes descriptions, images, and possibly links to each project and 
social media. This page highlights the person's accomplishments and demonstrates their skills 
and abilities through their past work.

##Step 4: HTML Elements:

HTML elements like “h1”, “h2”, “p”, “table”, “form”, “div”, “ul”, “li”, etc., along with HTML5 
elements such as “Datalist”, “details” are used to structure and organize the content.

##Step 5: Adding Navigation:

In each HTML file, create a navigation menu (usually in the header or sidebar) to link to other 
pages. Use “a” elements to create hyperlinks.
Link each menu item to its corresponding HTML page.

##Step 6: Adding CSS:

Selectors are used to target HTML elements and apply styles using various CSS properties.
Different color schemes, typography, layout, and other design elements are created to achieve the 
desired look and feel.
In this website creation I have used 
Embedded / Internal CSS (within HTML file):
Create a separate “style” section inside the “head” of each HTML file.
Define styles using selectors, properties, and values.
This approach allows you to maintain styling within each HTML file.
External CSS (in separate CSS files):
Create separate CSS files for each type of CSS (e.g., “styles_inline.css”, “styles_internal.css”, 
“styles_external.css”)
within the “css” folder.
Link these CSS files to your HTML pages using the “link” tag in the “head” section.

##Step 7: Testing and Refinement:

Open each HTML file in a web browser to check how they look and navigate.
Make necessary adjustments to the layout, styling, and content to ensure everything is displayed 
correctly and is user- friendly and done for each page
